# Hello-World
1st stab at learning Github

# So, here we go.
# I'm going to write a little bit about myself here. 

# 1st things first, I'm a recent MBA graduate having a pretty difficult time finding work. Got a few irons in the fire rn, but I am actively looking still and am filling my time building more that I think are in higher demand than the skills and knowledge I have from my BA: Bus Admin; Finance from WSU and my MBA from WGU. (little salty about not easily finding work, but there's no sense in ignoring the reality of the situation)

# On GitHub I'd love the opportunity to work on projects where I can build skills in web/software dev, as well as data science. I've looked at Codecademy.com, coursera, etc. I honestly don't have the spare cash/income to spend a few hundred dollars, so that's not really an option rn. I'd really like to just be presented with some problems and just figure it out by learning languages, exploring libraries, and collaborating with others trying to do the same thing. 

# On that note, Everyone's welcome! 
# I'd love to talk to y'all, work on stuff together, and eventually maybe even monetize the skills, experiences, and knowledge gained on here. 

# I also gotta give a S/O to Josh Fluke, guy gave me the mindset shift I needed to get my a** in gear and know that I just gotta get working, hustling, and get ahead of any skill gaps I may have. 

# Check him out youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Tychos1, discord: https://discordapp.com/channels/298175239777419284/627590273156907008 and you can figure out the rest if you're interested

# Anyway, if anyone's got something they're working on I'm interested, and if anyone's got some ways I can earn some cash lmk
